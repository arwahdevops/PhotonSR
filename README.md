## üìù Description

**PhotonSR** is a powerful and user-friendly text replacement tool that allows you to:
- Replace text patterns in files across directories using command-line arguments.
- **NEW:** Use an interactive Text User Interface (TUI) wizard for a guided experience.
- Create automatic `.bak` backups before modifying files.
- Restore original files from these backups.
- Clean up (delete) all backup files in a directory.

The TUI mode is particularly helpful for users who prefer a step-by-step process over typing out all command-line flags.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Text Replacement** - Replace strings in all matching files.
- üßô **Interactive Wizard Mode (TUI)** - A user-friendly, step-by-step terminal interface for all operations (built with Bubble Tea).
- üíæ **Backup System** - Auto-create `.bak` files before modification.
- ‚èÆÔ∏è **Restore System** - Revert files from `.bak` backups.
- üßπ **Clean Backups** - Delete all `.bak` files.
- üìÅ **Pattern Matching** - Target files using wildcard patterns (e.g., `*.txt`, `src/**/*.go`).
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation** - Enhanced checks for inputs like directory paths and file patterns in TUI mode.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling** - Improved feedback for both CLI and TUI modes.

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- `curl` or `wget` installed on your system.
- `tar` installed (for extracting the downloaded archive).
- For standard Linux/macOS systems, you might need `sudo` privileges if installing to a system directory like `/usr/local/bin`.

### Easy Installation (Recommended)

You can install PhotonSR with a single command using either `curl` or `wget`. The script will automatically detect your OS and architecture, download the latest version, and install it to a standard location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `$PREFIX/bin` on Termux).

**Using `curl`:**
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arwahdevops/PhotonSR/main/install.sh)"
```

**Using `wget`:**
```bash
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arwahdevops/PhotonSR/main/install.sh)"
```

After installation, you might need to open a new terminal session or source your shell's configuration file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`) for the `photonsr` command to be available.

### Manual Installation (from Source)

If you prefer to build from source:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Go 1.24.2 or newer (update this if your `go.mod` specifies a newer version).
    *   Git

2.  **Clone and Build**:
    ```bash
    # Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/arwahdevops/PhotonSR.git
    cd PhotonSR

    # Build
    go build -o photonsr ./cmd
    ```

3.  **Install Manually**:
    Move the compiled `photonsr` binary to a directory in your `PATH`.
    ```bash
    # Example: install to /usr/local/bin (may require sudo)
    sudo mv photonsr /usr/local/bin/
    # Or for Termux:
    # mv photonsr $PREFIX/bin/
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

`PhotonSR` can be run in two modes: **CLI Mode** (using command-line flags) or **Wizard Mode** (interactive TUI).

### üßô Wizard Mode (Interactive TUI)

This is the recommended mode for ease of use. It will guide you through the steps for any operation.

To start the wizard mode, simply run:
```bash
photonsr
```
Or explicitly:
```bash
photonsr -wizard
```

The wizard will prompt you for the action (Replace, Restore, Clean), target directory, text, patterns, and other necessary options.

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Mode

Use command-line flags for scripting or if you prefer direct commands.

#### Basic Command Structure
```bash
photonsr [OPTIONS] -old "OLD_TEXT" -new "NEW_TEXT"
photonsr [OPTIONS] -restore
photonsr [OPTIONS] -clean
```

#### Common Options
| Flag         | Alias | Description                                       | Applicable To       |
|--------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `-wizard`    |       | Run in interactive wizard (TUI) mode.             | (Mode selection)    |
| `-dir`       |       | Target directory (default: current directory `.`) | All operations      |
| `-pattern`   |       | Filename pattern (e.g., `*.txt`, `main.*`)        | Replace             |
| `-old`       |       | Text to replace (required for replace operation)  | Replace             |
| `-new`       |       | Replacement text (required for replace operation) | Replace             |
| `-backup`    |       | Create `.bak` backup files before modification    | Replace             |
| `-restore`   |       | Restore files from `.bak` backups                 | Restore             |
| `-clean`     |       | Delete all `.bak` files in the target directory   | Clean               |
| `-version`   |       | Show application version and exit.                | (Global)            |


**Note:** If `photonsr` is run without any operation flags (`-old`, `-restore`, `-clean`) and `-wizard` is not specified, it will default to launching the **Wizard Mode**.

## üí° Examples

### 1. Simple Replacement (CLI)
Replaces "foo" with "bar" in all `.md` files within the `docs` directory.
```bash
photonsr -dir docs -pattern "*.md" -old "foo" -new "bar"
```

### 2. Safe Replacement with Backup (CLI)
Replaces "http://" with "https://" in all files (default pattern `*`) within the `src` directory, creating backups first.
```bash
photonsr -dir src -old "http://" -new "https://" -backup
```

### 3. Restore Files (CLI)
Restores original files from `.bak` files in the `project` directory.
```bash
photonsr -dir project -restore
```

### 4. Clean Backups (CLI)
Deletes all `.bak` files from the `data` directory.
```bash
photonsr -dir data -clean
```

### 5. Using Wizard Mode
For any of the above operations, or if you're unsure about the flags, simply run:
```bash
photonsr
```
...and follow the on-screen prompts.

## üìã Important Notes

1.  **Backup Safety**:
    *   Backup files (e.g., `filename.txt.bak`) are created in the same directory as the original file.
    *   Original file permissions are preserved on both the modified file and the backup file.
2.  **Pattern Matching**:
    *   Uses standard Go `filepath.Match` glob patterns:
        *   `*` matches any sequence of non-separator characters.
        *   `?` matches any single non-separator character.
        *   `[set]` matches any one character in set.
        *   `[^set]` matches any one character not in set.
        *   For more complex needs, consider tools with regex support.
3.  **Case Sensitivity**:
    *   Text replacement is case-sensitive by default. "Foo" will not match "foo".
4.  **Safety First**:
    *   **Always double-check** your replacement text (`-old` and `-new`), target directory (`-dir`), and file patterns (`-pattern`) before execution, especially in CLI mode.
    *   It is **highly recommended** to use the `-backup` flag (or confirm backup creation in wizard mode) for critical operations. Test on non-critical data first if unsure.
